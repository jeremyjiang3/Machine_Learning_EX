Hello Kasha and 8th staff,
Thanks for your attached offer.But I am wondering if there is promotion going on for a lower rent rate or are there alternative options. 

Here are a few things I am confused about:
     1.Current Market Rate
     The current rate I have was set last year in August, when market supply was far less than demand.Only a few units were available at a high market rate that period of time. But now the market rate is much lower than the lease rate I signed. I searched on the website, There are some types of units (like C5) really similar to my current unit. The rent you are posting on the website is around $2500, which is $200 short of my current rent. Shouldn't we have a lower rate when we renew the lease?
     2. Unit Location
     Since I live on the second floor, my apartment is right above the garage and trash room. I can hear the trash truck's noise in the very early mornings. I believe this unit should set lower rent due to the noisy location But I find there are similar units now available at higher floors that have lower rent than my unit. Could you please explain to me why similar units at higher floors have lower rent instead? 
     3. Promotion 
     I really appreciate your renewal offer with no rent increase. But I also find there are promotions going on the website. I understand it's 2-4 weeks free for new applicants, but it makes me wonder shouldn't old residents have similar sort of benefits also in this uncertain time? 

Again, thank you for the renewal offer. But I am hoping the renewal rate or alternative option is negotiable.

Best,
Apt 203
